A raytracer that makes use of Rust-generated WebAssembly (WASM).

WebAssembly is a kind of supplement to regular JS that can "**execute...nearly as fast as native machine code**." â€”[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) (or read more on [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly))

To test this speed claim, I've adapted [this regular JS raytracer tutorial](https://tmcw.github.io/literate-raytracer/) to use Rust-transpiled WASM instead (see the code in [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs)). Raytracing is computationally demanding, requiring various bits of vector math for each pixel, so we should see a performance boost from using WASM.

When you toggle between the equivalent code in JavaScript and in WASM, the JS version is demonstrably sluggish.
